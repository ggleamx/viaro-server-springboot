Some guidelines for the upcoming technical assessment:

You are free to choose the programming language(s) you deem appropriate.
The application can be of the following types:

Web
Mobile

R:
Web >> vue 3.


You can choose the frameworks, ORMs, and database management systems you consider. We are interested in a good balance between functionality and visual interface, prioritizing that everything requested works.
The code must be your own.

R:
Spring boot for the server
Postgres
Hibernate for the ORM
Vue 3 for the client

You are expected to use programming logic and understand each step you've taken, not just copy and paste code without knowing what it does or how it does it.

Description:

A solution for school data management is required, meaning that CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) are needed for the following entities:

Student: Id, First Name, Last Name, Gender, Date of Birth
Teacher: Id, First Name, Last Name, Gender
Grade: Id, Name, TeacherId
StudentGrade: Id, StudentId, GradeId, Section (group).
The system should provide CRUD operations for each entity.

Once you complete the CRUD, package it into a .zip file and upload it to this platform. Also, keep a copy for yourself. You should also answer the questions in this test.

Note: Some terms like CRUD, ORM, and others are typically not translated as they are standard terms in the technology industry.
